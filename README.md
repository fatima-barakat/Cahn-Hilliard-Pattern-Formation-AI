# Pattern Formation on Surfaces: AI-Assisted Cahn–Hilliard Modeling

## Overview
This project explores pattern formation and wavelength selection in nonlinear surface dynamics using the Cahn–Hilliard equation.
Due to computational constraints, we focus on simplified one-dimensional simulations and demonstrate how machine-learning models
can act as surrogate predictors of pattern characteristics.

The goal is to illustrate how AI can complement classical physics-based modeling by learning trends in nonlinear PDE behavior
without requiring high-performance computing resources.

## Scientific Background
The Cahn–Hilliard equation is a nonlinear partial differential equation commonly used to describe phase separation and
pattern formation in materials and surface systems.
Here, we investigate how physical parameters influence emergent length scales and morphology.

## Project Objectives
- Generate low-cost, physics-inspired simulation data
- Extract dominant wavelength and pattern statistics
- Train machine-learning models to predict pattern features
- Compare AI predictions with physics-based trends
